yeah.
but i mean if you're saying we only got one each at gap all he has is one blue navy.
well he has actually he has two each with the name on it so he has two white and two blue.
mhm.
so plus his one blue navy.
is it hard to use the two he already has?

i did though.
one ticket is a combination of our birthdays.

right.
so i figured alright there are five of us but that takes it down to four.
right?
okay.
five numbers in each category.
yeah.
so that brings it down to four.
and then the fifth one i did it six.
for our anniversary.
and that's my favorite number too.
is it?
mhm.
and then because you have to do a powerball too.
mhm.
so i was just gonna do a quick pick on that one but then i said you know what?
seventeen again.

no in the powerball you can.
you can?
yeah if you pick.
